# Image recovery using voronoi diagrams
## Usage
```
python delaunay.py
```
Put a random-sampled **image.jpg** and a **points.txt** in the same directory to start the calculation. The points.txt should have the following structure:
```
[x-coordinate] [y-coordinate] [red] [green] [blue]
[x-coordinate] [y-coordinate] [red] [green] [blue]
[x-coordinate] [y-coordinate] [red] [green] [blue]
[x-coordinate] [y-coordinate] [red] [green] [blue]
```

## TODO
- [ ] Better usage
- [ ] quality assessement
- [ ] statistics, metrics etc.
- [ ] weird stuff happpens when closed
